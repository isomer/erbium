Erbium
======

Erbium[^0] provides networking services for use on small/home networks.  Erbium
currently supports both DNS and DHCP, with other protocols hopefully coming soon.

Erbium is currently very early in development, and is not yet ready for _any_
use (production or otherwise).



[^0] Erbium is the 68th element in the periodic table, the same as the client
port number for DHCP.
