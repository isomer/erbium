Erbium
======

Erbium[^0] provides networking services for use on small/home networks.  Erbium
currently supports both DNS and DHCP, with other protocols hopefully coming soon.

Erbium is in early development.

   * DNS is still in early development, and not ready for use.
   * DHCP is beta quality.  Should be ready for test use.
   * Router Advertisements are alpha quality.  Should be ready for limited testing.



[^0]: Erbium is the 68th element in the periodic table, the same as the client
port number for DHCP.
